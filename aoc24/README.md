# Advent of Code 2024

To execute a solution for a given day, run the following from the root of the
repository:

```
cargo run --release -p aoc24 <DAY> < <INPUT_FILE>
```

## Benchmarks

All benchmarks were ran on a 2021 Macbook Pro M1 Max. The time taken to parse
the input is included in each part's benchmark.

Benchmarks can be ran with `cargo bench`.
